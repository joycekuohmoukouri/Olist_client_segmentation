# Olist client segmentation


---

## **Goal**

For the Brazilian E-Commerce platform, the goal of the project was to explore the best client segmentation model possible using unsupervised machine learning. Different clustering methods are compared.

Spoiler : The classic RFM segmentation still works the best !


The data was collected here :  [Olist client public database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). I explore and joined the 8 tables via the creation of an SQL database.
